Computer Vision Best Practice
=============================

This [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package provides command line tools
based on Microsoft's open source Computer Vision Best Practice
repository available from
<https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision>.  Individual command
line tools are packaged for common computer vision tasks including
image classification and object detection, based on a collection of
pre-built computer vision models. These command line tools aim to be
used as part of a Linux pipeline of image processing commands. The
package also provides an interactive demonstration as an overview of
the capabilities of the repository.

Giving computers some semblance of vision (and the implied ability to
process the images and identify the content) has become practical with
the massive compute and training data that is available today. A
number of pre-built machine learning models are freely available for
this task and through this package we make them available for command
line scripts.

Command Line Tools
------------------

In addition to the *demo* presented below, the *cvbp* package provides
useful command line tools. Below we demonstrate a number of
these. Most commands take an image as a parameter which may be a url
or a path to a local file.

**classify**

The *classify* command will identify the dominant object in a photo
with a level of confidence. The confidence, class, pre-built model
used, and filename are printed and can be piped on to other commands
within a command line. This can allow us to add the class as a tag to
the meta data of an image file.

This example image from the Internet is classified 100% as a koala by
the default resnet152 model.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Koala_in_Australia.JPG)
```console
$ ml classify cvbp https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Koala_in_Australia.JPG
1.00,koala,resnet152,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Koala_in_Australia.JPG
```

As an example of command line processing, we could download this photo
(noting its license) and add the appropriate tag to it:

```console
$ wget -O koala.jpg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Koala_in_Australia.JPG
$ exiftool koala.jpg | grep -i comment
$ ml classify cvbp koala.jpg |
  cut -d, -f2 |
  xargs bash -c 'mogrify -comment $0 koala.jpg' 
$ exiftool koala.jpg | grep -i comment
Comment                         : koala
```

Coffee mugs seem to be fairly standard fare for image classification:

![](https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/cvbp_cup.jpg)
```console
$ ml classify cvbp https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/cvbp_cup.jpg
0.68,coffee_mug,resnet152,https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/cvbp_cup.jpg
```

Different pre-built image classification models are available. Here we
use a more complex model to provide a more confident classification of
the coffee mug:

```console
$ ml classify cvbp --model=resnet152 https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/cvbp_cup.jpg
0.85,coffee_mug,resnet152,https://cvbp.blob.core.windows.net/public/images/cvbp_cup.jpg
```

If no image is supplied on the command line then the computer's webcam
will be used to source a live feed and any objects held up to the
camera will be classified. The live classification is available within
the displayed live video image.

```console
$ ml classify cvbp
```

If there is more than one camera on the computer then the command may
not select the best one. For example, you may have an infrared camera
and a webcam on your computer. If the resulting window is all green,
then the infrared camera has been chosen. To choose your webcam the
use of the *--webcam* command line option may help:

```console
$ ml classify cvbp --webcam=1
```

The *--webcam* command line option is also supported across other
commands that use the webcam, including *demo*.

Multiple images can be classified with one command line:

```console
$ ml classify cvbp images/*.png
0.98,chickadee,resnet152,images/image_01_bw.png
0.99,custard_apple,resnet152,images/image_02_bw.png
1.00,echidna,resnet152,images/image_03_bw.png
0.98,Great_Pyrenees,resnet152,images/image_04_bw.png
0.96,beacon,resnet152,images/image_05_bw.png
0.68,Maltese_dog,resnet152,images/image_06_bw.png
0.91,great_white_shark,resnet152,images/image_07_bw.png
0.13,banana,resnet152,images/image_09_bw.png
0.90,redshank,resnet152,images/image_10_bw.png
```

We can add a tag to photos which are classified with a confidence
greater than 75%. This might allow us to later on search for photos
using the photo meta-data tag.

```console
$ ml classify cvbp images/*.png | 
  awk '$1>0.75{print}' |
  cut -d, -f2,4 | 
  tr ',' ' ' | 
  xargs -d'\n' -n1 bash -c 'mogrify -comment $0 $1'
```

The default pre-built model used for classification is resent152 as
note above. A collection of alternative pre-built models is available
and can be accessed using the --model option. The available models can
be listed with --model=list. 

```console
$ ml classify cvbp --model=list
densenet201
alexnet
densenet121
densenet161
densenet169
densenet201
resnet101
resnet152
resnet18
resnet34
resnet50
squeezenet1_0
squeezenet1_1
vgg16_bn
vgg19_bn
```

All models can be selected with --model=all. Note that the first time
a pre-built model is utilised it will need to be downloaded from the
Internet, which can take a little time. 

```console
$ ml classify cvbp --model=all images/*.jpg
0.44,espresso,densenet201,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.73,coffee_mug,alexnet,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.44,coffee_mug,densenet121,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.81,coffee_mug,densenet161,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.42,coffee_mug,densenet169,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.44,espresso,densenet201,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.81,coffee_mug,resnet101,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.85,coffee_mug,resnet152,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.68,coffee_mug,resnet18,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.76,coffee_mug,resnet34,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.48,coffee_mug,resnet50,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.71,coffee_mug,squeezenet1_0,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.68,coffee_mug,squeezenet1_1,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.54,coffee_mug,vgg16_bn,images/coffee_mug.jpg
0.83,coffee_mug,vgg19_bn,images/coffee_mug.jpg
1.00,kite,densenet201,images/kite.jpg
1.00,kite,alexnet,images/kite.jpg
0.98,kite,densenet121,images/kite.jpg
0.99,kite,densenet161,images/kite.jpg
0.99,kite,densenet169,images/kite.jpg
1.00,kite,densenet201,images/kite.jpg
0.99,kite,resnet101,images/kite.jpg
0.88,kite,resnet152,images/kite.jpg
0.91,kite,resnet18,images/kite.jpg
0.98,kite,resnet34,images/kite.jpg
1.00,kite,resnet50,images/kite.jpg
0.75,kite,squeezenet1_0,images/kite.jpg
0.95,kite,squeezenet1_1,images/kite.jpg
1.00,kite,vgg16_bn,images/kite.jpg
1.00,kite,vgg19_bn,images/kite.jpg
```

Otherwise individual models can be chosen with --model=densenet201,
for example.

```console
$ ml classify cvbp --model=densenet201 images/*.jpg
0.44,espresso,densenet201,images/coffee_mug.jpg
1.00,kite,densenet201,images/kite.jpg
0.66,balance_beam,densenet201,images/yogapose.jpg
```

**detect**

The *detect* command, in addition to identifying objects, returns the
bounding box for the objects found in the image, consisting of the
left top and right bottom coordinates.

```console
$ ml detect cvbp images/*.{jpg,png}
1.00,cup,61,59,273,244,images/coffee_mug.jpg
1.00,bird,86,56,605,761,images/kite.jpg
0.83,dog,28,100,200,186,images/image_04_bw.png
0.16,sheep,30,100,195,184,images/image_04_bw.png
0.05,cow,241,125,255,204,images/image_04_bw.png
0.74,person,89,50,193,190,images/image_06_bw.png
0.22,horse,86,48,195,193,images/image_06_bw.png
0.17,dog,106,52,193,181,images/image_06_bw.png
0.08,umbrella,6,55,236,238,images/image_07_bw.png
0.99,bird,37,31,251,246,images/image_10_bw.png
```

As with *classify*, with no argument the webcam is deployed to obtain
images and to detect objects in real time.
